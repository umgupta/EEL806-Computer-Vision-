This assignment is about motion understanding. I try to figure out motion in video by some heuristics taking motivation from kalman filter. It is not a kalman filter in exact sense. I demonstrate different things with this assigment. 
- In one of the result, I replaced moving car with a carpet. 
- In another one we try to just put some other color on moving object.
- In yet another we try to wipe out the moving car and guys. See the results folder for a demo of the videos. 

You know we can easily temper with history this way ;)
